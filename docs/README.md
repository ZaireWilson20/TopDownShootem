# Recess Rumble

Recess Rumble is a game designed by Matthew Levine, Dhruv Patel and Zaire Wilson for our Software Development class at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. We worked on this project to develop our software development skills. We are hoping to continue this project after the class is over and improve our game into a viable product for people to play during the quarantine.

Recess Rumble is designed to be a top-down shooter that incorporates tactical shooter designs to be unique in its field. The game is set in a playground (not for our demo we're not graphical designers) we're students will be battling for control of the best part of the playground. At launch we will be incorporating Team Death Match (TDM), Capture the Flag (CTF) and Free For All, a plan has been made to create King of the Hill but that is not in development at the moment.  

Our game has core features that are needed to work, they are:
